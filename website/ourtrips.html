       <li><a href="trip1.html" >Arizona Bike Tour </a> </li>
          <p>Is this a mirage? Vast skies above the Sonoran Desert. Towering saguaro cacti bursting to life in
           the spring. Splashes of color across the earthy terrain. Roadrunners—and cyclists!—revitalized by
           cooler fall temperatures. Boutique hotels and charming resorts in quaint artists' towns. It's not a
           mirage. It's Arizona.</p>

       <li><a href="trip2.html"> Israel Family Bike Tour </a></li>
       <p>
           Israel will captivate you at every turn. Delve into this place shaped by prophets, kings and crusaders.
           Discover a rich tapestry of cultures. And explore a diverse landscape, from the azure
           Mediterranean to the green hills of the Golan Heights, via the unique perspective that only a bicycle
           can offer.
       </p>

       <li><a href="trip3.html">Sweden to Denmark Family Bike Tour </a></li>
           <p>What would your family say to tasting fresh baked cinnamon buns in Sweden? And fencing on the grounds
           of a Danish castle? Riding along a fjord. Pedaling by red farmhouses and whimsical homes. Visiting
           castles whose names you can't pronounce. Meeting some of the world's happiest people. Maybe even being
           one of them. What would you say?</p>

       <li><a href="trip4.html"> Switzerland Multi Adventure Tour </a></li>
           <p>Escape with us to greener pastures, where waterfalls tumble, lakes dazzle in outrageous shades of blue,
           and gondolas carry you within yodeling distance of glaciated peaks. You'll even sleep in the shadow of
           the Eiger's north face. And you won't quite believe what you see. An altitude-induced mirage? Just
               another moment of alpine bliss in Switzerland.</p>

       <li><a href="trip5.html"> Tuscany Umbria Bike Tour </a></li>
          <p> No doubt you'll arrive with certain expectations of Tuscany and Umbria. But somehow the sensory feast
           is still a wonderful surprise. The sheer beauty of olive groves and vineyards. The slow pace of life.
           The symphony of flavors in traditional dishes. And the rich passione of the locals. Expectations
           exceeded? Just another day in the heart of Italy. </p>
