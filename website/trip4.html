        <h4>Get the Most Out of Each Day</h4>
        <p>Coordinating multiple activities throughout a single day can be tricky, but with Acme Adventure
            Travel you'll never know it. When you explore Switzerland with us, you switch activities seamlessly
            without missing a beat. We invented the multi-adventure concept, and we're constantly adding new
            dimensions and fine-tuning the experience to make it even more enjoyable.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Everyone at Their Own Pace</h4>
        <p>We design and support our Switzerland trips to suit mixed abilities and varied interests—so you
            can set your own pace, then change things up as the day unfolds. And all guests are free to do the
            same, traveling together or apart, with no one cramping anyone else's style. Which sounds easy in
            theory, but it's hard to pull off. Here's more on how we do it.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>More Leaders to Support You</h4>
        <p>On our Switzerland trips we have an extra leader supporting you along the road and trail—for a
            total of three, compared to the industry standard two. So we can be in more places at once, giving
            personal attention to guests traveling at their own pace. Here's more on our Trip Leaders.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>We Live in the Neighborhood</h4>
        <p>Our Trip Leaders in Switzerland live in the area and are deeply engaged in their communities, giving
            them unique inside knowledge they're happy to share in making your experience that much richer.
            They'll introduce you to people, customs and parts of town you'd likely never encounter on your
            own—and teach you a few local phrases to help break the ice.

        <h4>We Invented the Multi-Adventure Trip</h4>
        <p>After more than 30 years of creating Acme Adventure Travel Multi-Adventures, our trip designers know
            how to blend the perfect balance of biking and hiking with other activities to showcase the best
            of a region. And then they arrange the seamless transitions that would be so hard to orchestrate on
            your own—adding dimensions to your trip that are exciting, inspiring and just plain fun.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Signature Acme Adventure Travel Picnics</h4>
        <p>Guests rave about our picnic spreads. Enjoy a welcome break in a scenic spot, or a quick refuel stop
            if you don't want to lose momentum. And because we have two vans, one can host lunch while the other
            is out providing support along the route.

    <section>
        <h4>Experts with Secrets to Share</h4>
        <p>In choosing the ideal experts to enrich your travel experience, we look for people with a wealth of
            local knowledge, but also the ability to convey their insights in English. Too often travelers find
            themselves smiling politely, not quite understanding what they're being told. Our experts share
            intriguing facts, anecdotes and inside stories that stay with you forever.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Your Trip Will Run. Period.</h4>
        <p>Under our Book with Confidence policy, your Acme Adventure Travel trip will run even for one or two
            people (or a family of three or four), subject to a nominal extra fee. Or transfer to another trip
            , and we'll give you a credit. It's all part of our trademark commitment to treating guests with
            integrity, transparency and total accountability. Read all the details.

            back that up, rating our Trip Leaders an average of 9.75 out of 10 for all-around quality of

        <p>For nearly four decades we've worked to earn and maintain our right to call Acme Adventure Travel
            the world's #1 active travel company. In pursuing that vision on behalf of our guests, we believe
            we've set the standard for our industry—captured in the Acme Adventure Travel Quality Guide, which
            clearly sets out the benchmarks of excellence, choice and support that we live by

        <h4>Our Cultural Roots Run Deep</h4>
        <p>Thanks to our extensive connections in Switzerland, Acme Adventure Travel takes you off the beaten
            track and deep into the region's culture in ways that traditional travel can never hope to do.
            We know the people and their customs, the legacy of art and architecture, the complex history and
            politic—and if we're not sure, our amazing local experts can fill in the blanks.
