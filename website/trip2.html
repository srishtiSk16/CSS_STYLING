       <h4>Everyone at Their Own Pace</h4>
       <p>We design and support our Israel trips to suit mixed abilities and varied interests—so you can set
           your own pace, then change things up as the day unfolds. And all guests are free to do the same,
           traveling together or apart, with no one cramping anyone else's style. Which sounds easy in theory,
           but it's hard to pull off. Here's more on how we do it.
       </p>
   </section>
   <section>
       <h4>Your Trip Will Run. Period.</h4>
       <p>Under our Book with Confidence policy, your Acme Adventure Travel trip will run even for one or two
           people (or a family of three or four), subject to a nominal extra fee. Or transfer to another trip,
           and we'll give you a credit. It's all part of our trademark commitment to treating guests with
           integrity, transparency and total accountability. Read all the details.

       <h4>The Best Leaders in Israel</h4>
       <p>Acme Adventure Travel has the best-qualified people to lead your trip in Israel, and our guests back
           that up, rating our Trip Leaders an average of 9.75 out of 10 for all-around quality of performance.
           Get the facts (and no fluff) on how we recruit and develop the very best people for your trip.
       </p>
   </section>
   <section>
       <h4>Only the Best Hotels</h4>
       <p>On this trip featuring Premiere Hotels, you can count on the best lodgings Israel has to offer. In
           fact, the hotels we've chosen in this region have higher retail room rates than those offered by any
           other active travel company—even when their trips cost more.
       </p>
   </section>
   <section>
       <h4> Our Cultural Roots Run Deep</h4>
       <p>Thanks to our extensive connections in Israel, Acme Adventure Travel takes you off the beaten track
           and deep into the region's culture in ways that traditional travel can never hope to do. We know the
           people and their customs, the legacy of art and architecture, the complex history and politic—and if
           we're not sure, our amazing local experts can fill in the blanks.
       </p>
   </section>
   <section>
       <h4>Your Hotels Are Locked In</h4>
       <p>It may seem obvious to say the great hotels we tell you about are the ones you'll actually stay in.
           But the fact is many companies haven't even booked the places they promise and are later forced to
           settle for inferior alternatives. We book our hotels and exact rooms long in advance—often over two
           years—so you stay where you expect to stay.
       </p>
   </section>
   <section>
       <h4>A Second Van When You Need It</h4>
       <p>Acme Adventure Travel is the only active travel company providing two support vans in Israel—because
           we know it's essential to ensure a truly great travel experience. It doubles our ability to be there
           when you need us to offer hydration, lighten your load or give you a lift if it's time to take a
           break.  Read more on why two vans make all the difference.
       </p>
   </section>
   <section>
       <h4>More Leaders to Support You</h4>
       <p>On our Israel trips we have an extra leader supporting you along the road—for a total of three,
           compared to the industry standard two. So we can be in more places at once, giving personal attention
           to guests traveling at their own pace. Here's more on our Trip Leaders.
       </p>
   </section>
   <section>
       <h4>The Right Local Pairings</h4>
       <p>Our Trip Leaders combine deep local expertise with a firm grasp of North American expectations around
           quality of service. By the same token, we pair experienced Acme Adventure Travel leaders with local
           guides who know how to cater to your needs while cracking open the culture or natural history in
           ways that are meaningful, memorable and often magical.
