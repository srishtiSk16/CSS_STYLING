# CS351 Styling Assignment 

In this assignment you'll be practicing the styling skills reviewed in class.  You are welcome to explore outside of the course content to style the website.  There is a lot more HTML/CSS than what is covered in the class.  You'll be graded based on demonstrating you are able to apply the 7 style techniques listed below.

For the Styled Website assignment you're going to start with the HTML from the UnStyled assignment.  Start by copying all the contents of the previous assignment's website folder to this new repository's website folder.  This would be a good time to make a commit so you can rollback to this point if you need to.

You are not locked into the HTML from the first assignment you can and most likely will need to add changes to your HTML from just added class and id attributes to elements to reagranging the structure of the HTML itself.

Next you'll need to add a styles or css directory where you'll put your css files.  You can use one css file or organize your css into several files.

Next you'll want to add your links to your css files to your HTML pages.
After that you'll start styling your site.  You'll need to demonstrate several techniques we discussed in class to get full credit.

## 7 Objectives

* Apply a color palette to your site by setting text, background  and border colors. Here is a link to a webpage with color pallets you can use if you don't want to come up with one on your own https://designshack.net/articles/trends/best-website-color-schemes/ .
  

* Apply a font-family stack with fall back to font styles that will be available on all major browsers.
  

* Demonstrate understanding of the box model by setting margin, border and padding elements in your site.
  

* Demonstrate use of the Grid in the website.  I recommend using a semantic layout like the one we looked at in class and a grid layout to it.  The trip page is also an excellent candidate for a grid layout.
  

* Demonstrate the use of flexbox, a good candidate is the Why travel with us page.  The lodging and statements sections of the trip page are also good candidates for flexbox styling.
  

* Demonstrate the styling of a table.  The trip page should have a table in it for Departures.
  

* Make the styling of the site responsive, mobile and desktop friendly.  Demonstrate the use of Media Query to change elements in the site depending on if it's being viewed on a mobile phone or a tablet/desktop.  This doesn't mean you can't use values like px in your site.  Just make sure the site will view properly on any mobile, tablet or desktop browser.
  

  Lastly when you are done write up a report in the report.txt file telling me where you applied each of the requirements above.  This way I'll be sure to give you full credit for your work.  It can be a list of bullet points or a simple paragraph.

  The grading rubric will be based on how well you demonstrated each of the styling techniques and I will be giving partial credit so be sure to turn in what you've got even if you don't complete everly requirement.

  You'll not be graded on how well designed your site is, but rather on if you demonstrated that you know how to apply the styles above.  With that said you should do your best to make the site as well designed as possible.  These are skills that you'll need even if you are not a web designer.
